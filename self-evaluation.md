# Self Evaluation

- How do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - Reasonably confident on the basic functionality and what methods have been covered or what I've learned in my own research, but slightly overwhelmed by the sheer number and variety of methods.
- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next session?
    - I would like to do some investigation and find those methods I think will be most used and get comfortable with them; I don't think that trying to master every method is feasible, but I'd like to get a little more versatility before moving on. I also want to work out if there's any way to add elements in other positions or sort elements by various means.
- What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - Largely just the specific questions I detailed above.
